# VALKYRIE :fairy_woman: :eagle:

***A simple, fast, and light-weight runtime for Javascript. :fairy_woman: :eagle:***

## ABOUT :books:

The Javascript ecosystem is a mess. Node.js and NPM are messy and make package development and any other development a chore. Deno promised to change the ecosystem by addressing Node's problems. However, Deno is slowly morphing into what Node has become. To address this shortcoming and make Javascript development fast, easy, and fun, I decided to implement a smaller, faster and easier runtime with the mnost important advantages Deno has, minus all of Deno's shortcomings. This repository contains the source code for this runtime. This project is still work in progress.

## FEATURES :test_tube:

- First-class support for Typescript.
- Top-level async/await.
- Transpiles to ES 6.
- URL-Imports or import maps.
- Fast, simple, and easy to use.
- One light and tiny binary.
